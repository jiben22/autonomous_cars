                        <li>Reduction of accidents thanks to the better reaction time and equally with a greater reliability due to the computerized systems.</li>

                        <li>One can be alone in the car without having to drive, that means when we do not have a permit, and also when we are not in a state to drive due to tiredness, being drunk, sickness.</li>

                        <li>One of the great advantages, especially in the big towns, is to abandon the search of a parking place since the car can take care of it in our place, and it can even drop us at our doorstep.</li>
                        <li>With the previous advantage, this means a decrease in the number of parking spaces because the car can drop the occupants and park by itself much further away.</li>
